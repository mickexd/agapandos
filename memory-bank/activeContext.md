# Active Context: Los Agapandos Website Development

## Current Work Focus and Sprint Goals
- Integrating Swiper.js into `src/components/seccion4.astro` to create an attractive image carousel gallery.
- Ensuring the Swiper implementation adheres to existing design patterns, fonts, and colors of other sections (1-3).
- Resolving any technical issues arising from the integration.

## Recent Significant Changes
- Initial attempt to integrate Swiper.js using Web Components in `src/components/seccion4.astro`.
- Refactored styles in `src/components/seccion4.astro` to use Tailwind CSS and remove global conflicts.
- Reimplemented Swiper in `src/components/seccion4.astro` using traditional `div` structure and JavaScript initialization, with "coverflow" effect and specific slide dimensions.
- Fixed TypeScript error "Cannot find name 'Swiper'" by declaring `Swiper` as a global variable.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Finalize memory bank documentation updates.
- Confirm successful integration and styling of the Swiper carousel.

## Active Architectural Decisions
- Switched from Swiper Web Components to traditional Swiper setup (divs + JS initialization) for better control and compatibility within Astro.
- Prioritizing Tailwind CSS for styling to maintain consistency and avoid global style conflicts.
- Using CDN for Swiper CSS and JS bundles for simplicity and ease of integration.
